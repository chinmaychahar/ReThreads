# If you face issue regarding openSSL

issue:
 {
  opensslErrorStack: [ 'error:03000086:digital envelope routines::initialization error' ],
  library: 'digital envelope routines',
  reason: 'unsupported',
  code: 'ERR_OSSL_EVP_UNSUPPORTED'
}

Node.js v18.14.0


Try writing this command in terminal:-
set NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider

And then make this change in package.json file:-
"start": "react-scripts --openssl-legacy-provider start"


=> Steps for increasing the number of products in 'Products' page
- copied data from TopFeatured.jsx and pasted in a new file ShopData.jsx, changed TOPFEATURED function and default export TOPFEATURED to SHOPDATA on both locations

- Go to file Shop.jsx inside Component folder
- import SHOPDATA from ../ShopData.jsx
- changed all instances in the file from TOPFEATURED to SHOPDATA

Till here cards were added but the extra cards that were added did not got to deatils page when we clicked 'Buy Now'
Steps to resolve that:-
- Since ProductDetails.jsx file was taking data from TopFeatured.jsx file which is outside Components folde, I created another file named ProductDetailsForProductsPage.jsx

- Copied content of ProductDetails.jsx file here
- Changed all instances of TOPFEATURED to SHOPDATA

Now this file needed to be rendered when I click Buy Now in Shop.jsx file and previously in Shop.jsx file buy Now redirected to PRoductDetails.jsx file,
changes:- 
- created another path in App.js file where '/allProducts' will redirect to ProductDetailsForProductsPage
- Made changes in Shop.js and called '/allProducs' where 'Buy Now' is clicked


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
