## üíõ Introduction 
With ReThreads, we have developed a unique platform that operates on two fundamental pillars: donations and innovation

üìå The journey begins with generous donations from individuals who contribute their old clothing items

üìå Once these donations are received, our team carefully selects the garments to process

üìå Our volunteer designers and tailors work closely to redesign and modify the donated clothes, incorporating adaptive features

By repurposing and upcycling these donated garments, we not only make them affordable but also promote sustainability by reducing textile waste. Through our platform, individuals with special needs gain access to a wide range of stylish, adaptive clothing options that are both affordable and environmentally friendly. 

## üí° Why?
The problem we aim to tackle is clear and urgent. Across the world, there is a significant scarcity of cost-effective and adaptive clothing for differently-abled individuals. This scarcity deprives them of the independence, comfort, and self-expression that suitable clothing can provide. 

Traditional clothing options often fall short in meeting the specific requirements as they can be expensive and limited in accessibility for those already facing financial challenges. Moreover, the lack of adaptive features can hinder their ability to dress themselves confidently and comfortably.
